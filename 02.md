#Configuring the Local Configuration Manager (LCM)

Create a new file called LCM.ps1

Add the following content:
```powershell
[DSCLocalConfigurationManager()]
configuration LCMConfig
{
    Node localhost
    {
        Settings
        {
            RebootNodeIfNeeded = $true
        }
    }
}

LCMConfig
```

The attribute at the top declares that powershell should generate a
meta mof file rather than a normal configuration mof. This allows
us to configure the configuration manager (inception).

In this case, we'll simply allow DSC to reboot the system (without
much of a warning) if needed.

Now run `.\lcm.ps1`. Assuming everthing works, you now have a 
mof-file called localhost.meta.mof

To view the current LCM settings, you can use `Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager`

To apply the LCM configuration we use the following:
`Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path <directory of meta mof> -ComputerName localhost`

If you run `Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager` again, you should see
that RebootNodeIfNeeded should now be true.

Try to uninstall chrome (manually, through control panel).

Run your configuration from the first exercise again. You should see that chrome is
once again installed. But this time the machine will reboot instantly after the installation
is done. Once the server starts up again, DSC will ensure that the configuration will be continued.
This way, having multiple reboots during a configuration is not a problem.

Chrome should now be in the list of applications (which is really handy since you can't
use any built in browser as admin on 2016 ... ;-))

Next, we'll have a look at <a href="03.md">setting up a pull server</a>.
