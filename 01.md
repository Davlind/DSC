#Creating a basic configuration and run it

Create a new file called `MyConfig.ps1`

Add the following content (don't just copy and paste it, lazy ;-)):
```powershell
Configuration MyConfig {
    Import-DscResource â€“ModuleName 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration'
    
    Node localhost {
        WindowsFeature WebServer {
            Name = 'web-server'
            Ensure = 'Present'
        }
    }
}

MyConfig
```

MyConfig is just the name of the configuration and can be whatever
you want.

The Node name localhost will match any server. You can change this
to be the name of a specific server, or even pattern of a server name.

WindowsFeature is a resource and we've just named it WebServer.

Calling the `MyConfig` configuration in the last line will create the 
mof-file that will be used by the LCM (Local Configuration Manager).

Now run `.\MyConfig.ps1`. Assuming everthing works, you now have a 
mof-file called localhost.mof

Run `Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost`. This should fail as we have not 
yet applied the configuration.

Run `Start-DscConfiguration -Path <dir of your mof-file> -ComputerName localhost -Verbose -Wait`.
This will apply the configuration. Note that this can be done to a remote 
computer. We're just using localhost for simplicity.

Run `Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost` again. Fingers crossed, you should
now see the default IIS site.

---

Now, lets assume our website requires windows authentication. We need to
add that feature as well. The easiest way to find feature names (like web-server) 
is to use `Get-WindowsFeature`. If you, like me, find the list too long, you could
use `Get-WindowsFeature | ogv` and filter the output on the client side.

Try to add the IIS Windows Authentication feature yourself.

---

Next, lets try some other resource.

To view all available resources that are installed on the machine, run the
`Get-DscResource` command.

To see properties and how a specific resource should look, you can use 
`Get-DscResource <Name> -Syntax` E.g. `Get-DscResource WindowsFeature -Syntax`.

Try to have DSC create a new directory.

---

By default PowerShell contains roughly 20 DSC resources. Obviously, that might
not cover all your needs. Luckily, you can build your own resources, or use 
others that the community have already built.

To get a list of resources available at the PowerShell Gallery, use 
`Find-DscResource`. Note that this command is not perfect. Only DSC Resources 
that have been explicitly marked as such will show up. For example, `xChrome` is 
a resource which is not in the list. Therefore, when in doubt, it could be useful
to try `find-module <something>` to search for both DSC resources and normal
PowerShell modules.

To download and install a module, use: `Install-Module <name>`

Infact, try to fetch the xChrome module and have it automatically installed.

If you've come this far, you may have noticed the following log statement:
```
A reboot is required to progress further. Please reboot 
the system.
```

In the <a href="02.md">next section</a> we'll look into how to get the LCM to automatically reboot
when needed, and many other neat things.
