# Writing resources

Sooner or later you'll run into the case of not finding the perfect resource, already written.
Luckily, writing them yourself is not that hard.

Most resources for windows are written in PowerShell, but there are options. We won't go into 
details, but you can write DSC Resources in e.g. C#. For more information on this, 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/authoringresourcemofcs">click here</a>.

For this exercise we'll focus on how to create resources, rather than the logic within the resource.
To keep things as simple as possible we'll write a DSC Resource that creates a file with a specified
path and contents.

A DSC Resource consists of two things
1. A schema.mof file, defining the contract of your resource
2. A module file. Typically a .psm1 file for powershell

In addition it can also include a .psd1 file.

Folder structure is important, and typically it looks something like the following
```
$env:PSModulePath (folder)
    |- MyDscResources (folder)
        |- DSCResources (folder)
            |- Demo_IISWebsite (folder)
                |- Demo_IISWebsite.psd1 (file, optional)
                |- Demo_IISWebsite.psm1 (file, required)
                |- Demo_IISWebsite.schema.mof (file, required)
```

You can certainly create these files and folders manually etc, but it's generally recommended
to have DSC generate them for you. There's a module called `xDscResourceDesigner` that can help 
us with that. Let's install it via `Install-Module xDscResourceDesigner`

Now we can use PowerShell to generate the files and structure for us. 
```powershell
$Ensure = New-xDscResourceProperty –Name Ensure -Type String -Attribute Write –ValidateSet “Present”, “Absent”
$Path = New-xDscResourceProperty –Name Path -Type String -Attribute Key
$Contents = New-xDscResourceProperty –Name Contents -Type String -Attribute Write

New-xDscResource –Name cFileWriterPlusPlus –Property $Ensure, $Path, $Contents –Path ‘C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules’ –ModuleName cDemo_MyModule
```

The code above will create a new module, called cDemo_MyModule containing one DSC resource called 
cFileWriterPlusPlus. This resource will take the parameters Ensure, Path and Contents.

Take a few minutes to inspect the files under `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\cDemo_MyModule`

You may have noticed that the cFileWriterPlusPlus.psm1 contains three functions:
1. Get-TargetResource
2. Set-TargetResource
3. Test-TargetResource

These are the functions that DSC will use to determine if the configuration is applied correctly,
and if not, how it should be applied.

Change the Get-TargetResource to contain something similar to:

```powershell
    if (Test-Path $Path) {
        $Contents = Get-Content $Path
        return @{
            Ensure = $true
            Path = $Path
            Contents = $Contents
        }
    }

    return @{
        Ensure = $true
        Path = $null
        Contents = $null
    }
```
Get-TargetResource should return the current values. In our case, Ensure is not really relevant,
so we just set it to $true regardless.

Next, lets change Set-TargetResource

```powershell

 if ($Ensure -eq "Absent") {
        if (Test-Path $Path) {
            Remove-Item $Path -Force
        }
    } else {
        new-item -force -path $Path -value $Contents -type file
    }
```

Set-TargetResource will only be called if the configuration is not applied correctly, e.g.
something should change. In this case we remove the file if $Ensure is absent. Otherwise we
create it.

Finally, let's fix Test-TargetResource as well.

```powershell

    $current = Get-TargetResource -Path $Path

    if ($Ensure -eq "Absent") {
        if ($current.Path) {
            return $false
        } else {
            return $true
        }
    } else {
        if (($Path -eq $current.Path) -and ($Contents -eq $current.Contents)) {
            return $true
        } else {
            return $false
        }
    }
```

Test-TargetResource should return true if the configuration matches the current state.

That's more or less it. Give it a try. Create a simple configuration that's using your
shiny new resource. Even though your LCM might be in Pull mode, you can still force the
configuration to run using Start-DscConfiguration.
