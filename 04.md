# Using a Pull Server

We configure nodes to use a pull server by changing its LCM configuration.
Normally a Pull Server and the client nodes would typically be different 
servers. However, for simplicity, we will use the same machine for both
server and consumer.

Create a new file called UsePullServer.ps1

Add the following content:
```powershell
[DSCLocalConfigurationManager()]
Configuration LCM_HTTPPULL 
{
  param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string[]]$ComputerName,

    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$guid
  )      	
	
	Node $ComputerName {
	
		Settings {
			AllowModuleOverwrite = $True
      ConfigurationMode = 'ApplyAndAutoCorrect'
			RefreshMode = 'Pull'
			ConfigurationID = $guid
    }

    ConfigurationRepositoryWeb DSCHTTP {
      Name = 'DSCHTTP'
      ServerURL = 'http://localhost:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc'
      AllowUnsecureConnection = $true
    }
	}
}

# Computer list 
$ComputerName='localhost'

# Create Guid for the computers
$guid=[guid]::NewGuid()

# Create the Computer.Meta.Mof in folder
LCM_HTTPPULL -ComputerName $ComputerName -Guid $guid

```

This will configure the client to use Pull mode rather than the default Push.
Here we also specify that LCM is allowed to overwrite modules (in theory resources),
and also that it should Apply our configuration again if any drift is detected.

Run `.\UsePullServer.ps1` to create the meta mof.

To apply the LCM configuration we use the following:
`Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path <directory of meta mof> -ComputerName localhost`

If you run `Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager` you should see your configuration changes
reflected there.

---

Create a new configuration, like we did in excercise one. You can make configuration as
simple or complex as you like. We'll use it to test our Pull Server. 

Now, instead of applying the mof file directly, like we've done previously, we are going
to upload it to our Pull Server.

The pull server works slightly different in the way it handles what configuration is
mapped to what machine. Previously we've been used to seeing mof files named something
like localhost.mof or mycomputer.mof. Pull Server configurations are identified by Guid.
See that guid that we created and passed in to our LCM configuration at the top?! That's
the configuration that will be applied to the machine.

The easiest thing we can do is simply get our LCM Configuration ID by using 
`Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager  | Select ConfigurationID`, and then rename your mof-
file to the <guid>.mof. So it'll look something like bff0ddf2-9a0d-4e67-af3b-87877719b4b1.mof

Next, we need to copy the configuration to our Pull Server. Conviniently, we're using the
same VM for both server and client, so we can simply copy it to 
`$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration\`. Note that if you've used any
resource modules that is not already installed on the client machine, you'll need to upload
them too, to `$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Modules`. So where did we get 
these directories? If you go back to the previous exercise, you'll see that we specified them
there.

Once the mof is in the directory, use the `New-DscChecksum` on it. Having each client download
the full configuration frequently would consume unnecessary resources. Instead DSC uses checksum 
files for efficiency. This means you'll have to update the checksum if you change a configuration.
Guess how many times I've forgotten that, and have had no clue why this %#¤)#¤ is not working...


Now, in theory everything should be working. To verify this, we can either play the waiting game
or we could force our client to update its configuration using `Update-DscConfiguration`. Go 
ahead and run it, and verify that your configuration is applied.

To view LCMs runs, you can use the command `Get-DscConfigurationStatus -all`

You can also use `Get-DscConfiguration` to see what configuration is currently applied to a 
machine.


As of a few days ago, there's a new command called Publish-DscModuleAndMof which will handle
the upload of the files to the pull server, as well as creating the checksum files. You should
really be using that, but I wanted us to do it the old fashion way to build some understanding
of how it all works under the hood.

Next we'll look into <a href="05.md">writing resources</a>
